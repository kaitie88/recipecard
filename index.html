    My favorite comfort food is 100% chocolate chip banana bread. No matter the day or the weather, I always love this dish. It's an easy to make recipe, that anyone can do. Also, it doesn't have to be the same every time! Sometimes I make blueberry banana bread, other times I make chocolate chip walnut banana bread. It's always changing depending on my mood, which I find very conveinient! Although it's my comfort food, it is still pretty healthy. It's nice being able to eat something that tastes like a desert, but will not affect my health like one.
